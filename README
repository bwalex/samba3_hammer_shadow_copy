Getting and installing latest SAMBA source
-----------------------------------------------

# cd /home/repos && git clone git://git.samba.org/samba.git samba
# cd samba && ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
# gmake && gmake install

Now basic configuration for samba:

# cat > /usr/local/etc/smb.conf < EOF
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   server string = Samba Server
   security = user
   hosts allow = 192.168. 10. 127.
   log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m
   max log size = 50000
   load printers = no

   vfs objects = hammer_shadow_copy

# Backend to store user information in. New installations should
# use either tdbsam or ldapsam. smbpasswd is available for backwards
# compatibility. tdbsam requires no further configuration.
;   passdb backend = tdbsam

#============================ Share Definitions ==============================
[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no
   writable = yes

# A publicly accessible directory, read/write to all users. Note that all files
# created in the directory by users will be owned by the default user, so
# any user with access can delete any other user's files. Obviously this
# directory must be writable by the default user. Another user could of course
# be specified, in which case all files would be owned by that user instead.
;[public]
;   path = /usr/somewhere/else/public
;   public = yes
;   only guest = yes
;   writable = yes
;   printable = no
EOF

To start samba:
# /usr/local/sbin/smbd -s /usr/local/etc/smb.conf -d 9
# /usr/local/sbin/nmbd -s /usr/local/etc/smb.conf -d 9

* To stop it simply killall both processes.
# killall nmbd smbd

# cd smbshadow
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-samba-source=/home/repos/samba/source3 # (Do not forget source3 dir)
